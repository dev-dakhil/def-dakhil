### 🧠 My Philosophy in Code as "Puzzle Art" 🧱
To me, **Clean Code** isn't just a set of rules—it’s a satisfying feeling, much like putting together Lego pieces or solving a complex puzzle. 
I am passionate about organized code because:
- It reflects **Organized Thinking** and logic.
- It gives a **Great Sensation** of clarity and flow.
- It transforms programming complexity into a **Masterpiece** that anyone can understand.
